	This section controls whether or not you are using a backend or if the bot will be managing its own NAI requests.
	Set Mode to 'Backend' if you will be relying on an external backend,
	Set Mode to 'Contained' if the bot will be accessing the NAI api directly

	Set BackendUrl to the backend url the bot should make requests to. If you are using Contained, you can leave this blank

	Set ApiKey to your NAI token or your backend token if required.
	Set QueueLength to how many active commands may be queued. Note, this setting is global, so if your bot is in multiple
	servers, this queue is shared.
